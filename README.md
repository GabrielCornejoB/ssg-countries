# SSS Countries

Application that showcases the countries of the world and some details of each one of them!

## Why did I create this?

**SSG Countries** is a _re-do_ of one of my first applications while I was learning web development, you can find the original [here](https://github.com/GabrielCornejoB/fem-rest-countries-api). In the original version I made a lot of mistakes and this one is not perfect either, I just wanted to make it a little bit prettier and with some good practices.

## Technologies

## Cool stuff I learned

Even though this web application is really simple I learned and tried out some cool stuff, some where:

- New Angular 17 Syntax Flow.
- Creating pre-rendered (SSG) applications with Angular.
- Used the RxJs `forkJoin` operator to combine observables instead of having a subscription hell.
- Netlify CLI for deploying Angular apps.

## Notes for the future me / Some opinions

- Even though Angular 17 came with improvements in SSR and SSG, I still think that SPAs are the main strenght of Angular applications, so if you want to create apps that required that type of rendering it is better to use Astro or Next/Nuxt.
- You should try going back to using pure CSS in some projects, tailwind is great but you are way to comfortable with it and that's no good.
- Angular is cool but it is getting a bit overwhelming with the amount of changes it has every year, also React has a way bigger market so you should also go back to it.
